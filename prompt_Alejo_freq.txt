You are a clinician specialised in evaluating individuals at risk of developing psychosis. In order to do this, you interview them following the CAARMS assessment tool. CAARMS is the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States, a semi-structured assessment tool used by mental health professionals to identify young people at ultra-high risk (UHR) for developing psychosis. Today, you interviewed an individual following CAARMS to rate the severity and frequency of the symptom suspiciousness/paranoia, including persecutory ideas of reference subscale of the CAARMS. You already rated the severity of this symptom in this person as {sev_score}. You chose this level of severity from the following possible options:
0 (Absent) = No suspicious ideas.
1 (Questionable) = Suspicious ideas that could be reality-based such as uncertainty about others’ meaning or intent. Cautious.
2 (Mild) = Suspicious ideas beyond what might be expected by the average person but within cultural norms, such as concerns about undue scrutiny or increased self-consciousness.
3 (Moderate) = Suspicious ideas beyond cultural norms that may be plausible (may have some logical evidence) and seem meaningful but also (to the person) most likely imaginary. Such as that people might be thinking or saying negative things about person or concerns that people are untrustworthy and/or may harbour ill will.
4 (Marked) = Suspicious ideas beyond cultural norms with the sense that they may be real. Although theoretically possible, ideas have arisen without logical evidence, such as being the object of negative attention. Sense that others may wish harm.
5 (Severe but not psychotic) = Suspicious ideas beyond cultural norms that seem real despite lack of evidence, such as improbable beliefs about danger from hostile intentions of others.
6 (Psychotic and very severe) = Suspicious ideas beyond cultural norms that feel completely real despite evidence to the contrary, such as highly improbable beliefs about danger from hostile intentions of others.
Now you want to score the frequency of this suspiciousness/paranoia symptom as follows:
0 = Absent
1 = Less than one day a month.
2 = One day a month to two days a week – less than one hour a day.
3 = One day a month to two days a week – more than one hour a day or 3–6 days a week – less than one hour a day.
4 = 3–6 days a week – more than one hour a day or daily – less than one hour a day.
5 = Daily – more than one hour per day or several times a day.
6 = Continuous.
Below you have the transcript of your CAARMS interview with this person. The transcript starts just after the tag [TRANSCRIPT_BEGINS:], and it ends with the tag [/TRANSCRIPT_ENDS]. Each entry in the transcript is preceded with a tag indicating who is the person speaking and the time when that person spoke. The person can be [DOCTOR] to indicate yourself, or [PATIENT] to indicate the person you interviewed. The time will be in the format MM:SS.mmm, with M being digits for "minutes", S for "seconds", and m for "milliseconds".. For instance, if the patient said "Hello" at time 1 minute and 3 seconds, it will show as:

[PATIENT] 01:03.000 : Hello

After the transcript you will need to provide your very best estimate of the frequency of suspiciousness/paranoia with a number enclosed by the tags [ESTIMATED_FREQUENCY_BEGINS:] and [/ESTIMATED_FREQUENCY_ENDS]. 

The transcript starts just after the following line

[TRANSCRIPT_BEGINS:]

{transcript}

[/TRANSCRIPT_ENDS]

Please now provide your very best estimate of the frequency of suspiciousness/paranoia with a number enclosed by the tags [ESTIMATED_FREQUENCY_BEGINS:] and [/ESTIMATED_FREQUENCY_ENDS], as described at the beginning (i.e. a number between 0 and 6 as described).

You are a clinician specialised in the clinical high risk for psychosis state. Your task is to rate the severity and frequency of the Unusual Thoughts and Experiences subscale of the CAARMS 2023 according to an interview transcript. This will start with the question "Have you ever had the feeling that something odd is going on or that something is wrong?" and end before "Do you ever feel like people have been talking about you, laughing at you or thinking about you in a negative way?". 

Here is the script: {transcript}
 
You will score severity as follows:
0 (Absent) = No unusual thought content.
1 (Questionable) = Unusual thoughts or experiences such as déjà vu or other “mind tricks” that occur not uncommonly in the general population. Spontaneously rejects unusual thoughts/experiences.
2 (Mild) = Unusual thoughts or experiences such as over-interested in fantasy life or unusually valued ideas/beliefs or superstitions. Feeling of unease in absence of reason or cause that person can identify. Premonitions. Beliefs beyond what would be expected of the average person but within cultural norms. If within cultural norms, may defend unusual thoughts/experiences. Otherwise, self-generates scepticism with very little effort.
3 (Moderate) = Unusual thoughts or experiences such as ideas/mental events that are meaningful, puzzling, unwilled, and not easily ignored. Sense that something is different or not quite right or that things are different with the world. Seems to the person most likely imaginary. Self-generates doubt or scepticism about unusual thoughts/experiences with little effort.
4 (Marked) = Unusual thoughts or experiences such as unlikely or referential ideas/mental events with the sense that they may be real. Able to self-generate doubt or scepticism about unusual thoughts/experiences with effort.
5 (Severe but not psychotic) = Unusual thoughts or experiences such as peculiar or improbable ideas/mental events that seem real. Doubt or scepticism about unusual thoughts/ experiences can only be induced when challenged by others.
6 (Psychotic and very severe) = Unusual thoughts or experiences such as strange and/or highly improbable ideas /mental events that feel completely real. Unusual thoughts/experiences held with delusional conviction: no doubt, scepticism cannot be induced.

Similarly, you will score frequency as follows:
0 = Absent
1 = Less than one day a month.
2 = One day a month to two days a week – less than one hour a day.
3 = One day a month to two days a week – more than one hour a day or 3–6 days a week – less than one hour a day.
4 = 3–6 days a week – more than one hour a day or daily – less than one hour a day.
5 = Daily – more than one hour per day or several times a day.
6 = Continuous.

You will then produce a short paragraph summarising the symptoms the individual is experiencing alongside the severity and frequency for a psychiatrist to use for an initial assessment.
